**Vulnerability** - A security weakness or flaw that exists within a system that enables hackers to exploit it in order to gain unauthorized access or control over systems within a network.

---

**Exploit** - A tool or code that is used to take advantage of security vulnerabilities on a system. The threat actor or pentester will either acquire an exploit from various online sources or develop one on their own that has the capability of taking advantage of the security weakness.

---

**Attack** - A method or technique that is used by a threat actor to take advantage of (exploit) a security vulnerability (weakness) within a system.

The cibersecurity pro will present all the vulnerabilities and possible solutions to help the organization mitigate and reduce the risk.

---

**Attack surface** - All the vulnerable points of entry into a system, network, or organization that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access and expans their foothold on the network.

**Zero-day** - It's when a threat actor discovers a security vulnerability within a product or app and is able to exploit it before the vendor is either aware of the vulnerability or has time to develop a security patch to resolve the issue.

**Script kiddie** - He/She follows the instructions or tutorials of real hackers to perform their own attacks against a targeted system or network.

---

**Cyber terrorist** - Performs cyber-attacks that are designed to compromise communication channels and systems. To cause damage and disruption to create fear to a target society.
