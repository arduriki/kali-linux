# Build your own pentesting lab

## Tools

- Hypervisor: like VirtualBox or VMWare.
- Attacker machine with Kali Linux installed.
- Vulnerable machines
- Vulnerable web app: I'll be using _OWASP Juice Shop_ on Kali Linux using a Docker container.
- Internet access for the Kali machine to install apps, tools, software, etc.

### Diagram

- The Internet for accessing online resources and is directly connected to the Kali Linux virtual machine.
- The PentestNet environment, which contains 2 vulnerable machines that are on the 172.30.1.0/24 network and is also directly connected to Kali Linux.
- The RedTeamLab environment that contains an Active Directory (AD) infrastructure with a Windows server and 2 clients that are on the 192.168.42.0/24 network, and it’s directly connected to Kali Linux.
- The HiddenNet environment, which contains a single vulnerable host, that is, the Metasploitable 3 Linux-based machine on the 10.11.12.0/24 network and it’s reachable via the PentestNet network only. Therefore, we’ll need to compromise a host on the PentestNet environment and determine whether there’s a way to pivot our attacks.

Kali Linux's vNIC's:

- The internet using a bridged connection
- The PentestNet environment on 172.30.1.0/24
- The RedTeamLab environment on 192.168.42.0/24
